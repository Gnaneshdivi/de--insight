# Cryptosplit

## Proposed Solution:-
To build an application where "_groups of people_" get to manage and split their money, here **cryptocurrency**, over a seamless interface. Being the first-of-its kind application, we are sure to build an application that can track, analyse and also be a sort of a database of expenses.
